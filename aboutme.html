      <p class="amstyle p-3 font-weight-bold rounded">Hello, Iâ€™m George Fischetti. Currently, I am a Junior in high school. I am
        involved with two clubs, P.A.W.S. and Connect 4 Cancer. For P.A.W.S., I am the secretary and for Connect 4
        Cancer
        I am a co-president. I have been learning web design since September of 2021 starting with HTML, CSS, and
        Bootstrap. Later this year, I will be learning some javascript to create some extra effects on my website.
        Before
        web design, I took a class called digital media where I would meet Mrs. Leonard. Because web design was
        relatively
        new at this point, I was hesitant to enter but I had a feeling that this would be something I can do in the
        future. I tried it and found a massive amount of success later on and now I want to go in this route towards
        majoring in web design or some technology course in college.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <p class="amstyle p-3 font-weight-bold rounded">My inspiration for web design started during freshman year where it was
        time
        to start thinking about a major I should aim for. I took a class called Digital Media and this is where I met
        Mrs.
        Leonard. I breezed through that class (even though my photoshop and color combinations are not the best).
        Unfortunately, I went all virtual so I did not get a full experience. Then I later get recommended to take web
        design. I would go on to see Mr. Kilgore on a Google Meet and I would be sitting there, wondering "What is the
        purpose of this?" This would be a game changer as I tried web design with no prior experience and next thing I
        know, my major could potentially be this exact topic. Currently, I am part of the web design advisory board
        shown in the image below.</p>
